✅ Core SRE Skills and Competencies
🔧 Infrastructure & Systems Engineering
Deep understanding of Linux system administration (processes, networking, storage, logs).

Experience managing cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) using IaC tools like Terraform.

Managing and optimizing Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications (Docker).

Proficient in setting up and tuning load balancers, DNS, and reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy).

Experience with storage solutions (e.g., EBS, Azure Disks, NFS, CSI volumes).

⚙️ Monitoring, Observability & Incident Management
Experience with observability stacks: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Datadog, New Relic, ELK.

Set up and maintained alerting rules, SLOs/SLIs, and on-call dashboards.

Strong background in incident response, postmortems, and root cause analysis (RCA).

Knowledge of chaos engineering and system failure simulations.

🚀 DevOps & Automation
Designed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Argo CD, etc.

Implemented GitOps workflows for secure, repeatable deployments.

Automated infrastructure and operational tasks using Shell scripting, Python, or Go.

Created self-healing mechanisms using Kubernetes probes, auto-restarts, and rollout strategies.

🔐 Security & Compliance
Managed IAM policies, role-based access controls (RBAC) for Kubernetes and cloud platforms.

Familiarity with TLS/SSL, secrets management, and vulnerability scanning (e.g., SonarQube, Trivy).

Experience ensuring auditability and compliance (e.g., tagging, logging, patching policies).

📊 Reliability & Performance Engineering
Defined and enforced SLOs/SLIs to ensure system reliability targets.

Conducted load testing, latency tracking, and performance tuning across services.

Worked on horizontal and vertical autoscaling (e.g., HPA, Cluster Autoscaler).

👥 Collaboration & Communication
Worked cross-functionally with developers, QA, and product teams to implement best practices.

Wrote detailed runbooks, SOPs, and knowledge base articles for L1/L2 handover.

Conducted blameless postmortems and helped establish incident response playbooks.
