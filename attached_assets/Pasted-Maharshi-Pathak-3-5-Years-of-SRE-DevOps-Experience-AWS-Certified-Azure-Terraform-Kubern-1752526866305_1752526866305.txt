üîß My core strengths lie in:

* Automating infrastructure using Terraform, Shell, and Python
* Monitoring and observability with Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, ELK
* Building secure and repeatable GitOps pipelines with Docker, Helm, GitHub Actions
* Troubleshooting live production issues (50+ incidents resolved with 95%+ SLA)

üéØ Key achievements:

* Improved infrastructure reliability to 99% uptime
* Reduced incident resolution time by 25% through better observability
* Saved 10+ hours weekly via scripting and automation
* Delivered projects on both AWS EKS and Azure AKS, including multi-tier apps and GitOps pipelines

I hold the AWS Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate certification and am passionate about optimizing performance, minimizing downtime, and enabling development velocity through infrastructure best practices.

üìç Open to SRE, DevOps, or Cloud Engineer roles across Canada or remote positions in the U.S.

Thrilled to Announce: I'm Now an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate!

I am excited to share that I have successfully passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect‚ÄîAssociate exam! This journey has been challenging yet incredibly rewarding, deepening my understanding of architecting and deploying robust, scalable, and cost-effective solutions on the world's leading cloud platform.

This certification validates my proficiency in key areas, including:
Designing resilient and high-performing architectures using core AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, CloudWatch, and EKS.

Implementing secure and compliant applications by leveraging AWS security best practices.

Building cost-optimized infrastructures that align with business objectives.

I'm excited to apply my knowledge to a Cloud Engineering role. I am particularly interested in the intersection of cloud infrastructure with DevOps and SRE principles to enhance automation and system reliability

I look forward to connecting with fellow cloud professionals and exploring new opportunities in this ever-evolving space. 

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss cloud strategies or just connect!

As an IT Infrastructure Support Analyst at CRA, I ensured the reliability and scalability of critical government systems through automation, troubleshooting, observability, and infrastructure optimization. My work laid a strong foundation for adopting DevOps and Cloud practices within enterprise environments

Deployed microservices on AWS & AZURE EKS/AKS, provisioning EC2 instances and Kubernetes clusters, improving scalability and performance for internal tools used by over 1,000 users.

Automated routine operations using Python and Shell scripts, reducing ticket resolution time by 20% and saving 10+ hours weekly across the infrastructure support team.

Led monitoring and observability efforts using CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana, proactively identifying and resolving system bottlenecks, achieving 99% uptime for critical government systems.

Implemented Infrastructure as Code using Terraform to manage Kubernetes and AWS resources, with remote state stored securely in S3/DynamoDB, enabling consistent, version-controlled deployments.

Built and managed CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Argo CD, accelerating release cycles and reducing manual deployment effort by 60%.

Resolved over 50+ production incidents, including AWS VPC, DNS, and peering issues, maintaining 95%+ SLA compliance and minimizing unplanned downtime.

Improved application-level observability on Amazon EKS by implementing metrics, logs, and tracing, reducing incident resolution time by 25%.

Collaborated cross-functionally with DevOps, network, and security teams to optimize system performance, enforce compliance, and support seamless application delivery.
